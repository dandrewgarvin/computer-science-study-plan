# Computer Science Study Plan

## Introduction

This repository is a personal self-study guide to developing a greater understanding of core computer science topics. It will continue to be developed as my knowledge increases. This guide should be as an outline for each individual topic, and the "final project" for each topic should be a written article (or readme contained in this repo) to summarize what I have learned. Links to each completed project should be included under each item in the table of contents below.

## Table of Contents

- [Algorithm Analysis](Algorithm-Analysis/README.md)
