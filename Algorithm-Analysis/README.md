##### [BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS](../README.md)

_Introduction:_

This section on algorithm analysis is primarily focused on understanding the mathematic fundamentals that stand as the foundation to efficient programming. Many of the concepts here are theoretical, and can be used to deeply understand algorithms without even touching a computer. [Neat!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs)

_Goals:_
  - Find random kata solutions on codewars and analyze time and space complexity accurately
  - Ability to write out the time/space complexity of an algorithm (EG `O(log(n)^2)`, visual graph to display complexity at various `N` values, `400kb` total runtime usage)
  - Analyze functions in current codebase at work
  - Accurately estimate miliseconds to run a given program (based on input)
  - Accurately estimate static and dynamic size of a given program (file size, run-time memory usage at each stage)
  - Compare similar algorithms and understand pros/cons of each for a given task
  - Write an article/repo summarizing information learned

_Related Study Topics:_
  - Javascript Event Loop (and how it relates to algorithm effeciency)
